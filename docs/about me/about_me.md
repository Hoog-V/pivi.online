Hello, I am Victor. I am 21 years old and a fourth-year student in the Embedded Systems bachelor programme at the Arnhem-Nijmegen University of Applied Sciences. I am also a volunteer at SRCB (Stichting Repair Caf√© Barendrecht), a volunteer organization that repairs broken devices. My hobby is playing with electronics, primarily microcontrollers, FPGAs, and LED matrices. I have successfully completed several projects and enjoy sharing my progress and results on this website.
